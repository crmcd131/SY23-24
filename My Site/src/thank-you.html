        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Demu! If you landed here, it means you're on the lookout for something more than just off the shelf products. Demu isn't your typical retail experience, it's the great creation of two individuals who saw value where others saw expiry dates. </p>
        <p>We're picky about what makes it onto our website store because we believe in selling items that aren't just meant to last but also have a character that's rare in today's market.</p>
        <p>The idea for Demu took root  out in retail stores and estate sales, where Cade and Christian realized that many items that are past their prime actually held incredible potential. They saw not just goods, but craftsmanship, and value waiting to be recognized and popularized. From this realization, Demu was born.</p>
